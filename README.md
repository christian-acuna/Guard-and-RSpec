[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/christian-acuna/Guard-and-RSpec.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/christian-acuna/Guard-and-RSpec)

## Installation

- `gem install bundler`
- `bundle install`

## Running

- `guard`

## Structure

The set-up of the `Guardfile` is very specific to the directory structure you
have.

A typical structure is to have `lib` and `spec` folders. That's what our
`Guardfile` is based on.
